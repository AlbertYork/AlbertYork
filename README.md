This site is a collection point for the works of  Albert "Grandpa Owl" York.

Albert wrote a lot of great software over the years and though he is sadly no longer with us we wanted to preserve his legacy.

As you can see below Albert contributed a number of great utility programs to the IBM i community over the years. The TNxxx series in particular fill a niche left empty by IBM and even commercial software vendors. They have been used and enhanced by many people. Hopefully, some of those enhancements will make their way back into the base code in the future.

 - TNAPI - An IBM i API that allows batch programs to run interactive commands and programs. The package includes RUNTNSCR a utility program that runs scripts using TNAPI.

 - TNAPI132 - A variant of TNAPI for supporting 132 charcter screens. 

 - FmtRpg - A utility to format RPG/Free source files 

 - Fixfile - A file inquiry/update utility
 

The following are also available but only as executables. No source code is available.

 - TN400API - A Windows DLL that can be linked to any Windows program to access IBM i screens. Multiple sessions are supported.

 - Telnet/400 - A lightweight iSeries terminal emulation program
